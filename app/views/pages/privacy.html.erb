Our main purpose in collecting such information is to provide you with an excellent service and overall user experience. We go to great lengths to safeguard your information, and we aim to give you ultimate control in what information you share and how it is used. We strive to maintain transparency and will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Dee Duper will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (2) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (3) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Dee Duper, our Users or others.<br><br>

Dee Duper may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Dee Duper. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Dee Duper does not provide any PII to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Dee Duper to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
